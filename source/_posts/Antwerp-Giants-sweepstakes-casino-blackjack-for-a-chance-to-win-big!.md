#  Antwerp Giants Win Big in Casino Blackjack

The Antwerp Giants won a big casino blackjack game against Casino Helsinki, as the Belgian team secured an impressive victory with a final score of 21-10.

The Giants were dominant from the start, as they raced into an early lead and never looked back. Their hard-hitting offence was too much for the Finnish side to handle, and they were able to dominate both sides of the ball.

The Giants’ defence was also impressive, as they kept Casino Helsinki from scoring any touchdowns. This allowed them to cruise to a comfortable win and improve their record to 5-2 on the season.

This victory is a huge boost for the Giants, as they look to make a playoff run late in the season. They will need to continue playing at this level if they want to make it deep into the postseason.

The Giants will next take on the Saarland Hurricanes in a crucial matchup that could decide playoff positioning. If they can replicate this performance against the Hurricanes, then they should be in good shape moving forward.
