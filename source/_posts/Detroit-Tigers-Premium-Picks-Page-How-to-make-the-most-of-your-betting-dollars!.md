In this type of wager, you are betting that the Tigers will win by a certain number of runs. So, instead of betting on whether they will win or lose, you’re betting on how many runs they will score. In order for it to payout, the Tigers must win by two or more runs . The odds for this type of bet vary depending on the game, but are usually about +120 or -130 . So if you placed a $100 wager and Detroit won by three runs , you would receive a payout of $220 .

Another interesting type of bet is prop betting . This is where you can wager on all sorts of things other than who will win or lose the game. For example, you could place a bet on how many hits Miguel Cabrera will get in a game or whether Prince Fielder will homerun . There are endless possibilities when it comes to prop betting and the odds vary greatly depending on the proposition.

Knowing which bets offer the best chance to make money is essential when making your picks. Look at each game and decide which type of wager gives you the best edge. Detroit is always a good team to back and with these tips, you can make some serious profits!

The Detroit Tigers may have had a tough season last year, but this does not mean that they will not succeed in the coming season. In fact, there are many reasons to believe that the Tigers will be one of the most successful teams in baseball this year.

One of the main factors that give the Tigers a good chance at success is their lineup. While Miguel Cabrera is no longer playing third base, he is still leading the team at first base. He is backed up by Jeimer Candelario, who hit .266 with 12 home runs and 54 RBIs in 2018, and Niko Goodrum, who hit .235 last season. This batting order is definitely formidable, and it will be difficult for opposing teams to shut them down.

Another important factor that gives the Tigers a good chance of winning is their pitching staff. For instance, Matthew Boyd had a breakout season last year, finishing with a 7-11 record and a 3.88 ERA. He is joined by fellow starters Francisco Liriano (3-9, 4.92 ERA) and Jordan Zimmermann (6-8, 4.52 ERA), as well as closer Shane Greene (5-4, 2.57 ERA). With this strong pitching rotation, the Tigers are sure to keep games close and have a chance at winning even when their offense is struggling.

Overall, there are many reasons to believe that the Detroit Tigers will be successful this season. Their lineup is formidable and their pitching staff is solid. They also have some young players who are likely to improve this year. If you are looking for a team to bet on this baseball season, the Detroit Tigers should definitely be your top pick!
