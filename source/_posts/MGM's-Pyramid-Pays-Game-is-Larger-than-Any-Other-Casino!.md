#  What Makes MGM's Pyramid Pays So Unique?

The pyramid pays system was introduced in the early 1990s at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The system allows players to exchange their slot machine tokens for cash at a kiosk in the casino. This unique system has been replicated at other casinos, but MGM's pyramid pays kiosks are still considered the best.

The pyramid pays system is based on a four-level hierarchy. Players receive a payout based on their level, which is determined by how many tokens they have accumulated. The first level is for players who have between 1 and 99 tokens, the second level is for players with 100 to 499 tokens, the third level is for players with 500 to 999 tokens, and the fourth and final level is for players with 1000 or more tokens.

Players can move up to a higher level by exchanging their tokens for cash at the kiosk. The kiosk will payout the player according to their current level and the number of tokens they exchange. For example, if a player has 99 tokens and exchanges them for $5 in cash, they will move up to the first level. If they then exchange another 99 tokens for $5 in cash, they will move up to the second level.

MGM's pyramid pays system is unique because it offers players four levels of payouts, instead of just one like most other casinos. It also offers a wider range of denominations, which makes it easier for players to move up levels.
