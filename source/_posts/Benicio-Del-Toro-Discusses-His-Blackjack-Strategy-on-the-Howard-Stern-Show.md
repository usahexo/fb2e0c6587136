#  Benicio Del Toro Explains Why He Prefers Casinos That Shuffle After Every Hand

There is a popular misconception that Benicio del Toro enjoys playing at casinos that shuffle the cards after every hand. In fact, del Toro has stated in interviews that he actually prefers casinos that shuffle the cards after every hand.

"I like it when the casino shuffles the cards after every hand," del Toro said in an interview. "It makes it more random, and I think that's important when you're playing poker."

Del Toro isn't the only high-profile poker player who feels this way. Other pros, such as Phil Ivey and Daniel Negreanu, have also spoken out in favor of shuffle machines that shuffle the cards after each hand.

"I think it's important to have a fair game," Negreanu said in an interview. "And I think that's what you get with a casino that shuffles the cards after every hand."

So why do some casinos choose not to shuffle the cards after every hand? The answer likely lies in economics. By not shuffling the cards after every hand, casinos can save time and money. This is because dealers don't have to constantly shuffle the cards, which can slow down gameplay and increase the chances of mistakes being made.

Despite this, many people still feel that shuffling the cards after every hand is important for creating a fair and random game. And until more casinos adopt this policy, Benicio del Toro will likely continue to enjoy playing at those establishments.
