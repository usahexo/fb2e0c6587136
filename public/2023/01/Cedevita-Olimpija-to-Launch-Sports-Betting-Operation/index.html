        <h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-to-Launch-Sports-Betting-Operation"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-to-Launch-Sports-Betting-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija to Launch Sports Betting Operation"></a>Cedevita Olimpija to Launch Sports Betting Operation</h1><p>Cedevita Olimpija, a professional basketball team in the Slovenian Basketball League (SBL), announced on Tuesday its plans to enter the sports betting market in cooperation with Tipico, a Malta-based sports betting operator. The two sides signed a partnership agreement that will see Tipico become the team’s official betting partner.</p>
<p>The move is seen as a way for Cedevita Olimpija to further monetize its fan base and generate additional revenue. The club did not disclose the financial details of the deal but said that it is part of a wider strategy to develop new revenue streams.</p>
<p>“This agreement represents an important milestone in our club’s development and we are excited to be partnering with Tipico, one of Europe’s leading betting companies,” said Mladen Krstajic, president of Cedevita Olimpija. “Our fans can look forward to enjoying an even better experience when they come to our games and can also benefit from exclusive Tipico promotions.”</p>
<p>According to Tomaz Strel, CEO of Tipico Slovenia, the company is looking forward to working with Cedevita Olimpija and helping it grow its business.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be partnering with Cedevita Olimpija and look forward to helping them grow their business. This partnership is another example of our commitment to investing in European sport and we are confident that it will be successful both on and off the court,” said Strel.</p>
<p>Tipico has been active in Slovenia since 2012, when it acquired a license from state-owned gambling operator Športna loterija. It currently offers sports betting services through its websites tipico.si and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.tipico-njuskalo.si/">www.tipico-njuskalo.si</a> as well as via an iOS app.</p>
<h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-Seeks-to-Enter-Sports-Betting-Market"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-Seeks-to-Enter-Sports-Betting-Market" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija Seeks to Enter Sports Betting Market"></a>Cedevita Olimpija Seeks to Enter Sports Betting Market</h1><p>Cedevita Olimpija, a professional basketball team from Slovenia, is planning to enter the sports betting market. The company has announced that it will be opening a new betting branch in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>The team has been experiencing financial difficulties in recent years and is looking for new ways to increase its revenue. Sports betting is seen as a potential solution, as there is a large potential market for it in Slovenia. In addition, Cedevita Olimpija already has a well-known brand name, which should help it attract customers.</p>
<p>The team has not yet released any information about the exact date of the launch or the types of bets that will be offered. However, it is expected that the betting branch will include both pre-game and live bets.</p>
<p>Cedevita Olimpija is not the only basketball team to foray into the sports betting market. Earlier this year, Ludwigsburg Basketball Club, a German team, announced that it was partnering with Oddsring, a Swedish online bookmaker. The partnership will see Oddsring become the exclusive betting partner of Ludwigsburg Basketball Club.</p>
<h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-Joins-Growing-List-of-Clubs-Offering-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-Joins-Growing-List-of-Clubs-Offering-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija Joins Growing List of Clubs Offering Sports Betting"></a>Cedevita Olimpija Joins Growing List of Clubs Offering Sports Betting</h1><p><em>Cedevita Olimpija, a top-tier professional basketball club in Slovenia, recently announced it will offer sports betting services to its fans. This news comes as no surprise, as a growing number of European clubs are beginning to offer sports betting to their supporters.</em></p>
<p><em>Basketball is incredibly popular in Europe, and this new development will give fans another way to support their favorite teams. Club executives believe that the addition of sports betting will not only increase fan engagement but also help to generate additional revenue.</em></p>
<p><em>Sports betting is a fast-growing industry and Cedevita Olimpija is the latest club to take advantage of this trend. Fans can now place bets on a wide variety of sporting events, including soccer, basketball, and tennis. In addition, there are now a number of mobile apps that allow fans to bet on the go.</em></p>
<p>_ Clubs across Europe are recognizing the importance of offering sports betting services and Cedevita Olimpija is at the forefront of this movement. By giving fans another way to support their favorite teams, clubs can generate additional revenue and improve fan engagement. Fans can now look forward to placing bets on their favorite teams and watching them compete in exciting contests.</p>
<h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-Enters-New-Athletic-Betting-Frontier"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-Enters-New-Athletic-Betting-Frontier" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija Enters New Athletic Betting Frontier"></a>Cedevita Olimpija Enters New Athletic Betting Frontier</h1><p>The basketball clubs of the Slovenian capital Ljubljana are about to embark on a new joint venture, which will see them enter the world of online sports betting. The agreement between city rivals Olimpija and Cedevita was announced by the clubs on Wednesday, with both pledging to work together in order to create a new sports betting brand.</p>
<p>The move is seen as something of a natural step for both clubs, who already have considerable experience in the area of sport sponsorship. Indeed, it is hoped that the new venture will help to boost their profiles even further, whilst also generating extra revenue.</p>
<p>For Olimpija, in particular, the move is seen as a way of rebuilding its finances after suffering heavy losses in recent years. The club narrowly avoided relegation from Slovenia’s top flight last season and currently finds itself languishing in mid-table, some way off the pace set by eternal rivals Cedevita.</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news for Olimpija though, with the club having recently reached an agreement with local energy company Petrol which will see it become the team’s main sponsor for the next three seasons. That deal is thought to be worth in the region of 1 million euros per year.</p>
<p>Cedevita, meanwhile, is one of Croatia’s leading basketball clubs and currently sit third in the country’s top division. The team has been successful in European competitions in recent years and reached the semi-finals of this year’s Eurocup tournament.</p>
<h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-Looks-to-Capitalize-on-Booming-Sports-Betting-Industry"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-Looks-to-Capitalize-on-Booming-Sports-Betting-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija Looks to Capitalize on Booming Sports Betting Industry"></a>Cedevita Olimpija Looks to Capitalize on Booming Sports Betting Industry</h1><p>The Cedevita Olimpija basketball club is off to a strong start in the 2018-2019 season, thanks in part to the booming global sports betting industry. The club is based in Zagreb, Croatia, and competes in the Adriatic League, which is made up of clubs from eight Balkan countries.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, the global sports betting market is expected to reach $87 billion by 2020, up from $60.8 billion in 2017. This growth is being driven by the legalization of sports betting in a number of countries, as well as the increasing popularity of online and mobile betting platforms.</p>
<p>Cedevita Olimpija is well positioned to capitalize on this growth, given its strong brand and presence in the Balkan region. The club has won six league titles and five cup championships since it was founded in 1948. It also boasts a number of prominent players, including Croatian national team captain Bojan Bogdanovic.</p>
<p>In light of this growing industry, Cedevita Olimpija has announced plans to invest €3 million into a new training center that will include a gym, nutrition center, and hotel for visiting teams. This investment will help the club to recruit new talent and improve its performance on the court.</p>
<p>With a growing global audience and strong investment prospects, Cedevita Olimpija looks poised for success in the coming years. Thanks for following along!</p>
