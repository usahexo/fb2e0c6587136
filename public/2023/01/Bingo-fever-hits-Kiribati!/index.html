<p>The game is believed to have originated in Italy in the 16th century, and was brought to Kiribati by British missionaries in the early 20th century. Bingo has since become a popular pastime among I-Kiribati, with people playing for small sums of money or simple items like food or cigarettes.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, bingo has taken on a new dimension, with people betting large sums of money in the hope of winning big. This has led to some heated arguments and even violence among players, as they vie for control of the best bingo cards.</p>
<p>The government has tried to intervene by banning gambling on bingo, but this has done little to deter people from playing. In fact, it seems to have only made things more competitive, as players now have to resort to sneaky tactics in order to get an edge over their opponents.</p>
<p>Despite the risks involved, many people are still prepared to take a chance on bingo, hoping to win enough money to change their fortunes. Whether they will be successful remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure – Kiribati is definitely gripped by bingo fever!</p>
