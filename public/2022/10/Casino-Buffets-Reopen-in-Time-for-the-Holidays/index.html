Many casino buffets around the country are reopening in time for the holiday season, with all of your favorite traditional dishes.</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s Borgata is among the casinos getting into the holiday spirit, with a reopening on December 21 that offers all-you-can-eat crab legs, prime rib and sushi. The casino will also have a Christmas buffet on December 25 that includes dishes like glazed ham and gingerbread houses.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is getting into the action as well, with several buffets reopening in the next few weeks. Wynn’s Paradise Garden buffet is set to reopen on December 16, while Caesars Palace’s Bacchanal Buffet will be back in business from December 22 onwards. Both buffets are offering special holiday menus with dishes like roasted turkey and pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something a little different this year, how about a trip to the Choctaw Casino Resort in Durant, Oklahoma? Their new Jingle Bell Buffet offers an all-you-can-eat festive feast, with items like ham and yams on the menu.</p>
<p>So whether you’re looking for some traditional holiday fare or something a little more exotic, you’ll find what you’re looking for at one of America’s casino buffets!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Buffet-Restaurants-Set-to-Open-Tomorrow"><a href="#Casino-Buffet-Restaurants-Set-to-Open-Tomorrow" class="headerlink" title="Casino Buffet Restaurants Set to Open Tomorrow"></a>Casino Buffet Restaurants Set to Open Tomorrow</h1><p>The much anticipated casino buffet restaurants are set to open tomorrow morning. The restaurants, which were built as part of the recent casino expansion project, are expected to be a major draw for tourists and local residents alike.</p>
<p>The buffet restaurants will feature all-you-can-eat options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There will also be a variety of à la carte items on offer, as well as a wide selection of desserts.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard buffet fare, the restaurants will also offer a range of specialties unique to each establishment. For instance, the restaurant at the east end of the casino will specialize in seafood dishes, while the restaurant at the west end will focus on Italian cuisine.</p>
<p>Casino executives are optimistic that the buffet restaurants will be a big success. “We believe that our guests will appreciate the wide variety of food options that we’re offering,” said one executive in a statement to the media. “And we’re confident that they’ll find our prices to be very competitive.”</p>
<p>The buffet restaurants are scheduled to open at 8:00 am tomorrow morning.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Buffet-Owners-Pledge-to-Keep-their-Restaurants-Open-during-the-Government-Shutdown"><a href="#Casino-Buffet-Owners-Pledge-to-Keep-their-Restaurants-Open-during-the-Government-Shutdown" class="headerlink" title="Casino Buffet Owners Pledge to Keep their Restaurants Open during the Government Shutdown"></a>Casino Buffet Owners Pledge to Keep their Restaurants Open during the Government Shutdown</h1><p>Casino buffet owners have mobilized in a unified effort to keep their restaurants open during the government shutdown. The nearly two hundred buffet owners gathered together in Washington D.C. to pledge their support for one another and voice their concerns over the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>“This shutdown is a disaster for our businesses,” said casino buffet owner James Johnson. “But we’re not going to let it get us down. We’re going to keep our restaurants open and serving the American people.”</p>
<p>The casino buffet owners have been hit hard by the shutdown. They rely heavily on tourists visiting the casinos, and with many of those tourists staying away due to the government shutdown, business has taken a significant hit.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the casino buffet owners remain committed to keeping their restaurants open and serving the American people. They are hopeful that the government will soon reopen so that business can return to normal.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Buffet-Restaurants-Remain-Closed-as-the-Government-Shutdown-Continues"><a href="#Casino-Buffet-Restaurants-Remain-Closed-as-the-Government-Shutdown-Continues" class="headerlink" title="Casino Buffet Restaurants Remain Closed as the Government Shutdown Continues"></a>Casino Buffet Restaurants Remain Closed as the Government Shutdown Continues</h1><p>Casino buffet restaurants in the United States remain closed as the government shutdown continues. This is due to employees of the Department of Agriculture, who would normally work in these restaurants, being furloughed as a result of the shutdown.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture is just one of several federal agencies that have been impacted by the shutdown. As of Saturday, January 12th, 2019, the government has been shut down for 21 days, making it the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.</p>
<p>As a result of the shutdown, over 800,000 federal employees have either been furloughed or are working without pay. These employees include workers at the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and other agencies.</p>
<p>Many casino buffet restaurants are located on Native American reservations and are operated by the tribes themselves. These restaurants are not required to close due to the government shutdown and are actually seeing an increase in business as a result.</p>
<p>The Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise announced this week that its casinos will remain open despite the government shutdown. This is because gaming revenue is critical to funding many essential services on the Navajo Nation such as education and healthcare.</p>
<p>Other casinos on Native American reservations that are remaining open include Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut and Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut. Both properties are owned by the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut.</p>

The popular eateries had been forced to close their doors as a result of the budgetary impasse in Washington D.C., but are now poised to resume operations.</p>
<p>“We are glad to be able to welcome our guests back and serve them some of our delicious food,” said a spokesperson for one major casino chain.</p>
<p>The reopening of casino buffet restaurants is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the local economy. In particular, it is anticipated that the restaurants will generate significant revenue for hoteliers and other businesses in the tourist district.</p>
<p>It is hoped that lawmakers in Washington will be able to reach an agreement on future budget measures, preventing similar closures from taking place down the road.</p>
